# Introduction

This repository documents my personal research on the Hodge Conjecture.

This repo presents only select results, insights, and observations. Deeper development takes place across private or unpublished repositories, organized by focus area:

- `geometry` — spatial construction and structural logic  
- `algebra` — symbolic forms, equations, and transformations  
- `topology` — continuity, deformation, and connection  
- `calculus` — behavior through change and motion  

Each repo feeds into a unified geometric-algebraic model aimed at approaching the conjecture from a grounded, visual angle.

This is an independent, ongoing project. feedback and review are very much welcome.
